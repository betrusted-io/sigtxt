Contributions to this project are accepted on an
["inbound=outbound"](https://opensource.com/law/11/7/trouble-harmony-part-1) basis.
That means that you agree that your contributions are made under the
same license as the license for this project, the [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) [LICENSE](LICENSE)

To make this understanding explicit -- and for you to assert
that you have the right to make the contribution -- commits must be
signed off indicating acceptance of the
[Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](http://developercertificate.org/) [DCO](DCO)

A nice explanation of the DCO has been provided by
[Karl Fogel](http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/)
in his excellent book [Producing Open Source Software](http://producingoss.com/en/contributor-agreements.html#developer-certificate-of-origin).

An explanation of the "sign-off" procedure is given by
[Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst#11-sign-your-work--the-developers-certificate-of-origin).
